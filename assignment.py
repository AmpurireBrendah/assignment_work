#WITU has tasked you to automate a simple grading system.
#As a python student , write a program used to display the grades that the student will be receiving based on the mark scored in a subject.
# The grades are:
# 90%-100% Grade is A
# 80%-89% Grade is B
# 70%-79% Grade is C
# 60%-69% Grade is D
# 50%-59% Grade is E
# <50% Fail
marks_scored=float(input("Enter the student score in the subject (0-100):"))
#Validate the marks within a plausible range(0-100)

#WITU Academy is proposing a score to help students save their money .
#Design a platform that will do the following.
#Welcome to, WITI Academy Sacco.
#1 Deposit Money
#2 Withdraw money
#3 Check balance 
#Ensure if the student selects 1, money is deposited and the minimum deposit should be 1000.
# If the student selects 2, money should be withdrawn and a minimum withdrawal is 500.
# If the student selects 3, the account balance should be displayed.
